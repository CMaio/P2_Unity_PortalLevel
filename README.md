# P2_Unity_PortalLevel
This is a project we had to do for a course where we had to create a level 
similar to the game Portal by creating the base mechanics of the game.

Controls:
(First make a click on the game if you play it from Unity Editor)

WASD -> Movement
Space -> Jump
Mouse -> Move Camera
O -> Hide Mouse 
I -> Block camera movement

Portals are only allowed to establish on white surfaces
